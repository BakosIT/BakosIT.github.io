  <p>Nike started the Free series with the Free 5.0 in 2004 and in 2006
    released a new version of the shoe, the Nike Free 5.0 V2,
    that addressed some of the durability issues in the earlier
     model. Among other changes, the heel and sidewalls of the
     shoe were redesigned to prevent
  Since then, the Nike Free 5.0 V3 (2007), Nike Free 5.0 V4
  (2009), and Nike Free 5.0 V5 (2013) models have been released
   along with various other models from the Nike Free 3.0 V1,
   V2, V3, V4, and V5 to the Nike Free 7.0 V1 and V2.
