In May 2013, the Nike Hypervenom Phantom was launched. It was launched and designed for Brazilian forward Neymar.[3] The boot is currently in its third version. There is one high-end model for the first version, the Hypervenom Phantom; whereas, there are two high-end models for the second version—the Nike Hypervenom Phantom II, which is a mid-cut variant and the Nike Hypervenom Phinish, the low-cut variant. However, Nike chose to discontinue the Nike Hypervenom Phinish from the third silo onwards due to confusion that the mid-cut version was better than the low-cut. The mid-cut version will be called "Hypervenom Phantom DF".[4]

The boot is available in Soft Ground (SG), Firm Ground (FG) or Artificial Ground (AG) versions in which all feature a glass nylon soleplate. There are also Turf (TF) and Indoor (IC) versions, in which the high-end model of these variants is the Nike HypervenomX Proximo. The SG soleplate features 6 removable aluminium studs, in which different studs with different lengths can be used, and 6 fixed bladed studs. The FG version has 12 bladed and conical studs. The AG model contains many circular and hollow studs, meant to have more pressure distribution and trapping air to reduce impact and prevent injuries.</p>
