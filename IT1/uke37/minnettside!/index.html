    <p>We've picked out some of the most interesting factlets from the infographic,
      and a few snippets from around the web, that many people may never have
      known about the world's most famous sports brand.
<br>
1. Nike was founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports and
initially operated as a distributor for the Japanese shoemaker Onitsuka
Tiger (now known as Asics). It officially became Nike Inc. in 1971.
<br>
In 1976, the company hired John Brown and Partners,
based in Seattle, as its first advertising agency. The following year,
the agency created the first "brand ad" for Nike, called "There is no finish
line", in which no Nike product was shown. By 1980, Nike had attained a 50% market
 share in the U.S. athletic shoe market, and the company went public in December
 of that year.
